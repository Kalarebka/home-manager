- users able to have more than one board - show a default one on show board or show_board displays a list of boards?
or maybe a submenu in the navbar?
- htmx in board columns
- shopping list
- calendar
- when there are lots of separate apps, maybe something in user profile or on user main page to sum things up?
- maybe users should not be tied to boards, but be connected in groups, and then the group can have a board and select from other features
