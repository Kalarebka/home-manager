Done:
- fix max wip in board display
- show assigned user in task card
- make user profile pictures work
- make tasks colored according to priority
- add tiny assigned user picture in task cards

For a working version:
- finish index page (not logged in - description of the page and picture with a sample board;
                     logged in: show welcome message and user's assigned tasks)
- htmx for board display (deleting, editing and changing status of a task)
- write a readme
- security? make sure nothing bad will happen if it goes online
- joining existing board mechanism
- ability to delete messages
- change database to postgres
- user list - show existing boards and button to join if current user doesn't have one
- messages - reply button


Then:
- deployment - make it work in the internet
- write tests for basic functionality


Improvements:
- https://djangopackages.org/grids/g/calendar/
- Use more generic view classes
- Django Crispy Forms
- Django Widget Tweaks
- use django.contrib.messages to show stuff
- make user profile prettier
- make the whole front-end prettier
- users able to have more than one board - show a default one on show board or show_board displays a list of boards?
or maybe a submenu in the navbar?
- shopping list
- calendar
- when there are lots of separate apps, maybe something in user profile or on user main page to sum things up? - I think in future versions it's what will happen on the index page after logging in
- maybe users should not be tied to boards, but be connected in groups, and then the group can have a board and select from other features?
